## How?

jqkungfu was built by compiling [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/) to WebAssembly, so that it runs in the browser.

The advantages of this approach are:

* **Speed**: After the initial load time, jq queries are very fast because there are no round trips to a server
* **Security**: This approach runs jq within the browser; otherwise, we would need to carefully secure the app so that users can't run arbitrary commands on the server!
* **Convenience**: The app is purely front-end and is hosted as static files on a cloud storage provider

## Launch locally

To launch jqkungfu locally:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 9999
```

Then open [http://localhost:9999](http://localhost:9999) in your browser.

## Compile to WebAssembly (optional)

To compile jq to WebAssembly, run the `compile.sh` code within an environment that includes [Emscripten](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten).

To set up your environment:

```sh
# Make sure to use "--recursive" so the jq submodule is initialized
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/robertaboukhalil/jqkungfu.git

# Build the Docker image with needed dependencies
$ docker buildx build -t jqkungfu .

# Compile to WebAssembly
$ docker run --rm -it -v .:/src --entrypoint ./compile.sh jqkungfu
```
